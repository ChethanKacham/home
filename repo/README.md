### 1. What's the goal of our RAG process?

We're creating a process that pulls files from any Github repo so anyone can quickly interact with any repo.  We'll provide a dropdown with our default repos.

### 2. Why do we need to have the RAG system here

The home repo is being designed to explore progress toward UN Goals. It will allow anyone to customize if their own website to configuration for locations and topics.

### 3. How are users going to use the RAG model?

We'll have default prompts. Each RAG model can generate questions that relate to the unique data in the model.

### 4. How are users going to initiate the requests?

A #prompt textfield for inputing prompts.
Clicking the default prompts should send them to the #prompt field.
